CLASS REALITY

 Class Reality is an Educational VR experience that helps students 
 study. When compared to traditional flashcards, learning is made 
 more engaging by allowing students to move and react to a virtual 
 environment. Class Reality gamifies the learning process, letting
 students compete with one another for the highest scores.

 Class Reality was created in Unity V2021.3.8f1.
