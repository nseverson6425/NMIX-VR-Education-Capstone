1. BOW AND ARROW
    * The Bow and Arrow game was designed as a starting point for future groups.
     It is roughly half as complete as the Bomb Game, so using the Bomb Game as 
     a guide is recommended
    * Some places to start: 
        - Change the hand assets to match the Main Menu and Bomb Game (easy)
        - Decide if movement is required for the game overall. (The previous 
         2 developers had disagreements on this, so the bow game has no movement
         while the bomb game does) If so, implement into Bow, if not, change Bomb 
         Game/Main Menu accordingly
        - Use the Bomb Game's scoreboard, menu navigation, and finger ray selection 
         aspects to match the play style of the two games. (think of it like a HUD or 
         pause menu that is persistent between both games)
        - Create a valid scoring system, +5 for correct target, -1 for incorrect and 
         implement that system to update on the scoreboard
        - Have the bow and targets change questions/answers after a correct answer is
         hit (this goes with DATABASE CONNECTION below as you will need to fetch new Q&A's)
    * Watch these youtube link for a description of how the Bow works:

2. DATABASE CONNECTION/WEBSITE
    * A propper database connection is a must if there are any intentions to offically launch
     this game on a VR store
    * A sample SQL database as well as a php based website is provided under the Capstone_Website
     folder. This is a sample which is intended to be improved upon. THIS IS NOT A LIVE DATABASE/Website
        - For testing purposes, I use xampp and phpmyadmin to test database and website connection before 
         actually purchacing a live server. I recommend doing the same until you feel your database is
         secure and connection to Unity is solid
        - Upon importing the current database/making a fresh one, connect it to Unity via C# script.
         Google is helpful with this step.
        - After the website and database are implemented, use them to cycle through flashcards to use 
         in game. For example, after an arrow hits a correct answer, the target colors are reset, 
         the database is queried for the next question/answers, a new question is assigned to the bow,
         a new answer is assigned to each target, and the scorebaord is updated.
    * Under the user category in the database, a section should be added for high scores to be used in 
     the scoreboard.
    * Another helpful tip: add a "Study set" category to the website/database so all questions/answers
     are held under a set number, that way when you query a set, you can just cycle through all items
     in the set number
    * Lastly, make the website look good. It is bare bones right now, but again, if you intend for the 
     project to be published, some stylistic changes would be nice.

3. CLOSING REMARKS
    * I know this seems like a lot to accomplish, but once some things fall into place (mainly the database),
     the project will begin to be easier. 
    * Unity developement takes patience and practice, but I have no doubt that by the end of the semester 
     your group will have one of the greatest projects to ever come out of Capstone if you see it through.
    * If after reading all of this you decide this project is out of your wheelhouse, talk to your Capstone
     instructors. Capstone should be a fun but challenging project you work on for months, not a foreign 
     coding exprience that makes you want to cry.
    * I would highly recommend 2-3 developers to be added to this team with at least one specializing in 
     database setup/management, one specializing in Unity, and a third that could maybe help with a bit of 
     both

4. CONTACTS
    * Feel free to reach out to the previous 2 developers for any question and/or updates (group chat). Personally, 
     I (Nick) would love to see any updates and have no problem lending a helping hand if you feel stuck.
    * This project WILL be cooler than your peers' so expect jealousy when presenting. And remember,
     HAVE FUN with it. IF you finish up most of those above steps, change whatever you want, add whatever
     you want, make a 3rd game, etc. It's as much your project as it was ours!
